# Project Recap
 
 Social Buzz is a fast growing technology
 unicorn that need to adapt quickly to it’s
 global scale. 
Accenture has begun a 3 month POC
 focusing on these tasks:
 1. An audit of Social Buzz’s big data
 practice
 2. Recommendations for successful IPO
 3. Analysis to find Social Buzz’s top 5 most
 popular categories of content, monthly most post content, and top reaction of content

# Problem Statement

100.000 posts/day and 36.500.000 posts/year. Over the past 5 years, Social Buzz has reached over 500 million users each month. Due to their rapid growth and digital nature of their core product, they amount of data that they create, collect, and must analyze is huge. To solve this problem, requiring extreamly sophisticated and expensive technology to manage and maintain.  Out of the 250 people working at Social Buzz, 200 of them are technical staff working on maintaining this highly complex technology. Up until this point, they have not relied on any third party firms to help them get to where they are. However there are 3 main reasons why they are now looking at bringing in external 
expertise:  
-  They are looking to complete an IPO by the end of next year and need guidance to 
ensure that this goes smoothly.
-  They are still a small company and do not have the resources to manage the scale that 
they are currently at. They could hire more people, but they want an experienced 
practice to help instead.
-  They want to learn data best practices from a large corporation. Due to the nature of 
their business, they have a massive amount of data so they are keen on  
understanding how the world's biggest companies manage the challenges of big 
data.  

To start our engagement with Social Buzz, we are running a 3 month initial project in order  
to prove to them that we are the best firm to work with. They are expecting the following: 
- An audit of their big data practice
- Recommendations for a successful IPO
- An analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the 
largest aggregate popularity

# Process Flow
1. Data Understanding.

   All data sourced from Forage. There are three tables in CSV form, namely reaction type score data, content data, and reaction

2. Data Cleaning

    Merge table, then identify and handling missing value, duplicated data, and remoce unrelated columns for analysis

3. Data Modeling

   Create a final data set, then figure out the top 5 content categories, monthly most post, and top reaction. I did everything using a pivot table, then visualized it. For interactive visualization, you can access it in the file I attached

4. Uncover Insights

# Summary
 
  * Positive Engagement: Content generally elicits positive reactions and sentiments, with topics
 like travel, science, and lifestyle drawing enthusiastic responses.
  * Varied Emotional Reactions: Though positive responses dominate, certain content also triggers
 fear, concern, or neutrality, particularly in categories like animals and travel, where sensitive
 issues may be involved.
  * Consistent Content Creation: Content creation is fairly consistent throughout the year, with
 peaks in summer and holiday seasons, driven by travel, seasonal events, and lifestyle trends.
 The data reflects a diverse set of audience interests and emotional responses, with a clear
 preference for positive and engaging conten
